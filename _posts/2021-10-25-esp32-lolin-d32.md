# Purchasing
This video does a good job explaining which ESP32 to buy: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnoZYlyebBc&t=602s]. For prototyping, I’m picking the Lolin D32 because of its low power draw and use in breadboarding [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mu-bNwpnkiNUiM7f2dx8-gPnIAFMibsC2hMlWhIHbPQ/edit]

# Install
1. Download Arduino IDE: [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software]
2. Go to `File>Preferences` and drop [https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json] into libraries
3. Go to board manager, type in ESP 32, and install
4. Download CH340 Driver: [https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers/]
5. Get a 100uF capacitor and connect from EN to ground pin [https://randomnerdtutorials.com/solved-failed-to-connect-to-esp32-timed-out-waiting-for-packet-header/]
6. Test out a variety of usb cables until one works (the shorter the better)

# Testing
1. go to `Tools > board > ESP32 Arduino > select the Lolin D32 Board`

2. select the `Tools > Port > whichever COM port is available` 
- <img src="/assets/img/esp-32-2.png">
3. upload a blank sketch (`File > New`) 
- <img src="/assets/img/esp-32-3.png">
4. Try uploading the SimpleTime sketch
- Open: `File > Examples > ESP32 > Time > Simple Time`
- <img src="/assets/img/esp-32-4.png">
5. Put in your Wifi/password

7. Upload
8. Go to `Tools > Serial Monitor`
9. Tada

# Pins
Check out this spreadsheet for what pins to use [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gbKM7DA7PI7s1-ne_VomcjOrb0bE2TPZ/view]. This video helps explain it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY-1DHTxRAk].
## I2C (SDA/SCL)
For I2C connections, SDA pins of the microcontroller connect to SDA pins on the sensor, and likewise SCL connects to SCL.

On the ESP32:
* SDA: GPIO21
* SCL: GPIO 22

# Programming
## Asyncrhonous Webserver
This website is a treasure trove of good info on programming with the ESP32 [https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-with-esp32/]. However, if you want to control things from your computer/phone or see sensor input, here’s the steps:
1. Download the AsyncTSP library: https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP
- <img src="/assets/img/esp-32-7.png">
2. Download the ESPAsyncWebServer: https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer
3. Unzip both files
4. Drag into your Arduino Library Folder. 
- In my case, my Arduino folder was in my Documents folder, so the path was: `C:\Users\Username\Documents\Arduino\libraries`, but your path might be slightly different depending on where it’s located.

# Troubleshooting
## Com port not showing up
- <img src="/assets/img/esp-32-9.png">
1. open up device manager and check with ESP32 plugged in
- <img src="/assets/img/esp-32-10.png">
2. Now check without ESP32 but micro USB cable left in computer. If you don’t notice a difference, try a different USB cable OR try putting your laptop in full power mode (not battery saver).

3. Download CH340 Driver: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers/all
4. Install
5. Restart Computer
6. Tada
## Error uploading

1. Try new usb cable
2. Try putting 100 uF capacitor from the enable pin to the ground pin. This tutorial suggests a 10uF capacitor, but I’ve found a 100uF cap works better: [https://randomnerdtutorials.com/solved-failed-to-connect-to-esp32-timed-out-waiting-for-packet-header/]
