I always thought skincare was fairly vain, but unfortunately good skin equals good confidence. 

Here's some tips:
* Avoid dairy
* Apply sunscreen to your face before going outside
* Use a facial cleanser and moisturizer
* Shower at the end of the day or after you exercise
    * if you shower early in the day, wash your face with a facial cleanser at the end of the day
* Change your sheets and pillow cases at least once a week 
* Avoid touching your face
* Try and maintain a neutral face (don't wrinkle your forehead)
* Keep your hair out of your face
    * Either keep your hair short
    * Or use a [hairband](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VFYM5B5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 
* Sleep on your back if you can
* Avoid processes sugars (fruit is fine)
