# About Me
Hi, I'm Matt. I'm a 20-something grad student, mechanical engineer, [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/user/GalacticsTutorials/featured), [maker](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7IVAaYbsnq1icQKPBbQzzw), inventor, and self-proclaimed Pirate üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è(left the last one off my resume).

The purpose of this website is to share my free energy anti-entropy tesla turbine design before the energy companies suppress it (that was a [joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke) and evidence that I have a personality, despite any real-life interactions that may suggest the converse).

In all seriousness, I made this website because over the years, I've worked on a few projects and also mulled over many ideas from new types of renewable energy systems to beamed powered propulsion vehicles to low-cost cryocoolers. I want to share the knowledge I've accumulated with others to save them some time and the pitfalls I've found myself in. I'd also like to explore open-sourcing some of my invention ideas just to see what happens.

## Who am I?
Throughout history, people have identified themselves from where they‚Äôre from (I‚Äôm from [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), btw). In whatever year this is, people tend to describe themselves using singular words or phrases that signal an identity, I‚Äôll leave you with these words instead:

* I once memorized 251 digits of pi. That was a complete waste of time, but I did get $20 from it.
* I quit my YouTube Channel when I was around 16. Every winter, summer, and weekend, I have vowed to start posting videos again. Hopefully within the next decade, I'll get the motivation.
* For legal reasons, I can‚Äôt confirm that this is my work, but here‚Äôs a fan fiction about [Vladimir Putin](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10552727/1/VLADIMIR-PUTIN-DANCE-DANCE-REVOLUTION-MASTER)
* My GPA in high school was an unweighted 98.5, and my GPA in college was a 3.96/4.0. But none of that matters because I can never finish a project.
* I won a $30,000 grant and first place in a business competition. However, as of the time of writing this, I have never even sold a newspaper (see above bullet point).
* I have 2 provisional patents so far. You could too if you have $70 and the ability to produce a word document.
* A dream of mine is to build a self-sustaining ship in international waters and create my own micronation. But I‚Äôm about 1000 miles from the ocean right now and I forgot the password to my multi-billy crypto key, so that poses a slight issue.

## What Ideas do I have?
They‚Äôre mostly in the area of physics and engineering, but I do have some ideas/inventions in biology, psychology, business, and debate. Some broad categories are:
* propulsion (specifically [beamed powered propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam-powered_propulsion))
* energy generation and storage (similar to [HighView Power](https://www.energy-storage.news/news/highview-power-unveils-plan-for-first-500mwh-liquid-air-storage-project-in))
* carbon capture
* aerospace (ground effect vehicles, high altitude balloons, etc.)
* ergonomics/productivity (standing desks, biosensors, etc.)
* SLA-like 3D printers (for printing metal and other substances).
* lots of stuff with ferrofluid
* lots of opinions on how high school and college education should be conducted

## What are my values?
Read this if you want to cringe and haven't already:

While in high school, I may have been described as an [anarcho-syndicalist with anti-consumerist tendancies](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pretentious); now, my general life philosophy and guiding principles can be broadly described as:
* touch grass
* walk outside
* look at a mountain
* respecting people with differing values and decoding the air they vibrate within my vicinity
* open to sharing almost all information freely (possibly with royalties/licenses for business); however, I do understand why posting DIY thermonuclear fusion tutorials on YouTube could be problematic.
* listening to the [Andrew Huberman podcast](https://hubermanlab.com/)
* generally against certain business practices that involve the generation of single-use containers, planned obsolescence, fighting the right to repair, dehumanization (think about the supply chain of your phone), etc.
    * but I see the introduction of more conscientious (and well-marketed) businesses as the only practical solution
* **only buying one brand of socks so you don't have to sort your socks**
* life isn‚Äôt a zero sum game:
    * humans are able to turn resources into objects of higher value
    * but we do live in a world of finite resources (natural, economic, and human). 
    * Therefore, the best position is probably to avoid excess luxury (no yachts, which is a shame because I was going to buy one with my **massive** grad student stipend).
* using fancy words and being a moral elitist.
* getting very educated and lacking any real business experience, while claiming to value the opposite
